# Fuchsia

An attempt at creating a personal assistant that responds with and to text only.

Fuchsia is based on [Jared Cubilla's Jarvis](https://github.com/jaredcubilla/jarvis). The goal of Fuchsia is to create a similar virtual personal assistant that isn't limited by speech for responses.

# Features

## Say Hello

You can say `hi` to Fuchsia to get a response right back! Never feel lonely again.

## Open Websites

Have one large address bar to `go to` the website you want.

## See What's Good

You can ask Fuchsia if you should watch something using the key phrase, `should I watch`, and see what you should, shouldn't, and might watch. You can also ask about music with `should I listen to <artist-name>`.

## Search the Web

`Search for` tickets on the web to the movie you think is perfect for you from the comfort of the Fuchsia UI (which isn't actually fuchsia, oddly).

## ~~Where~~ When Am I?

Find out what time it is easily, along with the date, which features the day of the week as well. Always unsure what day it is? It's more fun to find out from your virtual personal assistant! Just ask `what time is it?`

## Toggle Goodnight

Change from your light theme to your dark one, or vice-versa. This happens automatically, but if you want your dark theme during the day or you light theme during the night, feel free to `toggle goodnight`.

## Clear the Log

You've been talking to Fuchsia for so long that the page is totally cluttered! You have too much conversation that you won't ever look at again. Obviously, you can `clear` the log.
