# Fuchsia

An attempt at creating a personal assistant that responds with and to text only.

Fuchsia is based on [Jared Cubilla's Jarvis](https://github.com/jaredcubilla/jarvis). The goal of Fuchsia is to create a similar virtual personal assistant that isn't limited by speech for responses.

## Features

### Say Hello

You can greet Fuchsia with any of the four key words (hi, hello, hey, and greetings) to get a response right back! Never feel lonely again.

### Open Websites

Have one large address bar to go to the website you want. Use the key phrase, "go to".

### See What's Good

You can ask Fuchsia if you should watch something using the key phrase, "should I watch", and see what you should, shouldn't, and might watch.

### Search the Web

Search the web for tickets to the movie you think is perfect for you from the comfort of the Fuchsia UI (which isn't actually fuchsia, oddly). Use the key phrase, "search for".

### ~~Where~~ When Am I?

Find out what time it is easily, along with the date, which features the day of the week as well. Always unsure what day it is? It's more fun to find out from your virtual personal assistant!

### Clear the Log

You've been talking to Fuchsia for so long that the page is totally cluttered! You have to much conversation that you won't ever look at again. Just say "clear", "clear log", or "clear logs" and start fresh again!
