# Fuchsia

An attempt at creating a personal assistant that responds with and to text only.

Fuchsia is based on [Jared Cubilla's Jarvis](https://github.com/jaredcubilla/jarvis). The goal of Fuchsia is to create a similar virtual personal assistant that isn't limited by speech for responses.

## Features

### Say Hello

You can greet Fuchsia with any of the four key words (hi, hello, hey, and greetings) to get a response right back! Never feel lonely again.

### Clear the Log

You've been talking to Fuchsia for so long that the page is totally cluttered! You have to much conversation that you won't ever look at again. Well just say "clear log" or "clear logs" and start fresh!
